After running various combinations it was observed the ttc with lidar and camera was not that different.
This is Median approach was used in both cases in Camera and Lidar TTC determination.

With detector type FAST got the best results for both ttc lidar and ttc camera. However, with detector type like HARRIS and ORB didnt get reliable value for ttc camera computations, also values for ttc lidar looked not that reasonable.

This document provides e ttccamera and ttclidar results for FAST-BRIEF , FAST - BRISK, FAST - ORB, HARRIS - ORB, ORB - ORB, SHITOMASI - ORB combinations for all the frame index.
